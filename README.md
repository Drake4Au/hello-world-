# hello-world-
I’m pretty sure that if your reading this that your much more aware of the issues I’ve faced these last two years trying
To make sense of things. When I was told
To speak on the changes I’ve made, at first I didn’t feel to good about
What I’d say. I have much that I hope
I get the opportunity to ask
You of forgiveness for. But, let me
Just state, I have kept my promise. I’ve never stopped loving you. I’ve never loved you so much. I got a number today so I expect to call here shortly. Not
Real sure what to expect. Hopefully I’ll at least I’ll have have some
Answers questioned
That I’ve been needing for
A long
While. I miss you. I miss you more than you could ever imagine. If
Possible, I’d love to hear the you’re voice sometime soon. Let me get back to setting this up. ❤️
